# Data Analysis and Visualisation in R

It has been said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. In this course, we introduce some relatively-new additions to the R programming language that make the process of manipulating and visualising data easy and intuitive.  

## Aims: During this course you will learn about:

- How R enables reproducible research
- What constitues a tidy dataset
- "Piping" commands together to form a workflow
- Subseting and Filtering datasets using dplyr
- The grammar of graphics approach to plotting used in ggplot2
- Producing summary statistics from a dataset
- Joining datasets using dplyr

## Objectives: After this course you should be able to:

- Create reproducible documents
- Import and tidy and dataset into R
- Use dplyr to explore a dataset interactively
- Produce simple analysis workflows in R
- Make publication-ready graphics using ggplot2
