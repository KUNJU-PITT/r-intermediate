- For a follow-on study, we are interested in overweight smokers
    + clean the `Smokes` column to contain just `TRUE` or `FALSE` values
- We need to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each of our patients
- $BMI = (Weight) / (Height^2)$ 
    + where Weight is measured in Kilograms, and Height in Metres
- A BMI of 25 is considered overweight, calculate a new variable to indicate which individuals are overweight
- (EXTRA) What other problems can you find in the data?
